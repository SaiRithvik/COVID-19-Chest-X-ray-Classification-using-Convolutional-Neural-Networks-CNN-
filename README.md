# COVID-19-Detection
Application of AI in healthcare aids doctors to diagnose diseases in early stages which wil help to reduce the number of casualties.
Saili and I worked on this project, which is based on building Convolutional Neural Networks which are trained on a balanced dataset of chest X-ray images and able 
to predict the probability that a Chest X-ray is COVID-19  infected or not with a high accuracy of nearly 99%.
